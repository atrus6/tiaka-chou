Taika Chou is a nethack inspired game with gestural magic casting.

You move down the levels of a maze, fighting monsters and grabbing
loot for the final treasure.

You cast magic by holding CTRL and moving your mouse in various patterns.
The closer your mouse drawn patterns are to the predefined spells, the
more powerful the magic is cast. Terribly drawn spells will hurt the
user.

Right now only generates Voxel based mazes and has a single spider that
moves randomly around.
